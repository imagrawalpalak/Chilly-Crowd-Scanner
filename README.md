# Chilly Crowd Scanner 
A marvellous counter app bulid using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Introduction
The motivation behind this app is to tally the number of passenger entering the subway station on the freezing cold day.

## Description

The person incharge clicks on the increment button to count the each batch batch of passenger and then it counter is restored to 0 again for this next batch. This helps to less the labour work need to done and eliminates the human error.

Obviously, this can be used for various purpose but here I took the prototype model as subway station on a freezing snowy day.
